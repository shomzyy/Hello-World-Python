    Hello-World-Python 
This repository contains a simple Python script that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. It was 
created as part of an assignment to learn how to use GitHub for version control. 
Steps I Followed 
1. Created a GitHub repository – I made a new repository called Hello-World-Python on 
GitHub. 
2. Wrote a Python script – I created a file called hello.py and added a basic print statement. 
3. Saved the file – Initially, I had trouble finding the file because it was in OneDrive instead of 
my local Desktop. I moved it to the correct location. 
4. Installed GitHub Desktop – I used GitHub Desktop to make the process easier. 
5. Added the file to the repository – After opening my repository in GitHub Desktop, I added 
hello.py and wrote a commit message. 
6. Committed and pushed the file – I committed the changes and pushed them to GitHub. 
Challenges I Faced 
File not found error – At first, when I tried running hello.py in the command prompt, it said the 
file didn’t exist. I later found out that it was saved in OneDrive instead of my local Desktop. I 
moved it and fixed the issue. 
Commit message confusion – I wasn’t sure what to write in the commit summary box at first, 
but I figured out that it should describe what changes I made. 
Checking the repository – I had trouble verifying if my file was uploaded correctly, but I found it 
by visiting my repository on GitHub. 
Conclusion 
This process helped me understand how to use GitHub for version control. I learned how to 
create a repository, add files, commit changes, and push them online. Even though I ran into 
some issues, I was able to solve them and complete the assignment successfully!
